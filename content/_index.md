# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my website!**

My name is Felix, and I needed a place to share the things that I do, so I created this website (check out [see more](/stack) to find the tools that I used for that). 

I'm a Ph.D. student at [TU Chemnitz](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/phil/politik/pf/professur/mitarbeiter.php.en) and I will be sharing what I explore, find and write there under [articles](/articles). My area is political science and I'm mainly interested in opinion formation, polarisation and welfare state attitudes, so if that sounds in any way interesting to you, stick around! 
It's not all my job, however, so sometimes there will be other things that I'd like to share. You can find those under [projects](/projects).

Have fun!
