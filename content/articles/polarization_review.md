### About
My Ph.D. supervisor, [Arndt Leininger](https://twitter.com/a_leininger) and I have decided to collect what we know about polarisation in multiparty systems in a review article that is now available on OSF. 

### Abstract
Inspired by increasingly partisan politics in the US, a burgeoning literatureon affective polarization applies the concept to multiparty systems. While thereare many literature reviews on polarization in the US, there exists as of yet nocomparable stocktaking of the research on polarization in multiparty systems.This review article fills this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of rele-vant concepts and operationalizations of ideological and affective polarization inmultiparty systems and by summarizing research on the causes and consequencesof polarization in these systems.
