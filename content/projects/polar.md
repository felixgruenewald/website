In my work at [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://tu-chemnitz.de/polmeth), I am involved in the research group "Polarization through and in referendums". Our first result is the **[Encyclopedia of Polarisation](https://polrefpolar.netlify.app)**, an online repository for information on the operationalizations, applications and resources relevant for researching polarisation. It also includes the package _polaR_, a collection of R code snippets to compute a range of polarisation measures on various datasets, the resulting data of which can be observed in the shinyapp below:
